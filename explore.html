				<h2>Python</h2>
				<a href = "https://www.python.org/downloads/"><img class = "symbol" src="Images/python.png" alt="python" height="150" width="150"></a>
				<p>Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world today, because of how functional it is and how easy it is to learn. It can be used for artificial intelligence, machine learning, game development, and many other things.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class = "l2">
				<h2>Java</h2>
				<a href = "https://www.java.com/en/"><img class = "symbol" src="Images/java.png" alt="java" height="150" width="150"></a>
				<p>Java is another very popular high-level object-oriented language that is almost as easy to learn as Python. As well as that, it is robust and dynamic, as it focuses on compile time checking and runtime checking. It is known for its portability and good performance.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class = "l3">
				<h2>Javascript</h2>
				<a href = "https://www.javascript.com/"><img class = "symbol" src="Images/javascript.png" alt="javascript" height="150" width="150"></a>
				<p>Javascript, abbreviated as JS, is a multi-paradigm language that uses just-in-time compilation. Just like Python, it has many functions, including adding interactive behaviour to web pages, creating apps, making games, and etc. In fact, this website actually contains some javascript.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class = "l4">
				<h2>C#</h2>
				<a href = "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/"> <img class = "symbol" src="Images/csharp.png" alt="c#" height="150" width="150"></a>
				<p>C# is another general purpose and multi-paradigm programming langauge that is primarily used on Windows. The majority of people say that C# is an easier langauge to learn than C++ and C, making it a perfect langauge for programming beginners.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class = "l5">
				<h2>R</h2>
				<a href = "https://www.r-project.org/"><img class = "symbol" src="Images/r.png" alt="r" height="150" width="150"></a>
				<p>R is a programming language mainly used for computing statistics and creting graphics. It is one of the best languages for data miners and people who like data analysis. However, it is notoriously hard to learn, as the syntax is very difficult to read. This is a good language to learn for those who are more professional.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class = "l6">
				<h2>C++</h2>
				<a href = "https://www.cplusplus.com/"><img class = "symbol" src="Images/c++.png" alt="c++" height="150" width="150"></a>
				<p>Despite having smimilar names and coming from the same family, C, C++ and C# and completely different langauges. C# is a component-oriented language, while c++ is object-oriented. It is a difficult language to learn, but it can be very useful once mastered. C++ is used to develop advanced games and graphical apps.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class = "l7">
				<h2>Swift</h2>
				<a href = "https://developer.apple.com/swift/"><img class = "symbol" src="Images/swift.png" alt="swift" height="150" width="150"></a>
				<p>Swift is a relatively new language, developed by Apple in 2014. The purpose of this language is to make the process of developing apps easier and more convinient. Swift code is much easier to read and write than many other languages. Swift is also known for its efficient debugging system.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class = "l8">
				<h2>PHP</h2>
				<a href = "https://www.php.net/"><img class = "symbol" src="Images/php.png" alt="php" height="150" width="150"></a>
				<p>PHP is a general-purpose scripting language that is used mainly for web development, embedded in HTML. Although many developers dislike PHP for it's inconsistent design, it is still among the most widely-used scripting languages today.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class = "l9">
				<h2>Ruby</h2>
				<a href = "https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/"><img class = "symbol" src="Images/ruby.png" alt="ruby" height="150" width="150"></a>
				<p>Just like PHP, Ruby is a high-level programming language used for building web applications. However, it also has many other applications like data analysis and prototyping. Ruby is a mix between an interpreted language and a compiled language. Like R and C++, this language is not easy to learn for beginners.</p>
